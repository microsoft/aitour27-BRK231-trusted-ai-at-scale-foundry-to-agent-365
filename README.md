## Before you're done

This repo has been created for your AI Tour 2027 session. Here's how to get it ready.

**Easiest path — use the agent (recommended):**

- Open GitHub Copilot Chat and say `help me initialize repo`. The agent will walk you through getting the README populated.
- When you're ready to publish, say `help me finalize repo`. The agent will clean up unused folders, validate everything, and remove this "Before you're done" section and other extra stuff that attendees don't need to see.
- Curious how it works? Read the [agent workflow](.github/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md).

**Doing it manually?**

Fill in the sections below yourself, then:

- Delete any placeholder folders you don't need (`data/`, `infra/`, etc.)
- Delete this "Before you're done" section
- Delete `.github/agents/`, `.github/tests/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `.github/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md` — these are template tooling, not part of your published repo

**Folder conventions:**

- Attendee step-by-step guidance goes in `instructions/`. If you use MkDocs or a docs site instead, put it in `docs/` and link to it from this README.
- Reference material and background reading go in `docs/`.
- Presenter notes, deck link, recordings, and re-delivery materials go in `delivery-resources/`. Fill in [`delivery-resources/README.md`](delivery-resources/README.md).
- You can add a `.devcontainer/` folder if needed.
